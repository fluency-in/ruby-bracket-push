# Ruby: Bracket Push

Make sure the brackets and braces all match.

Ensure that all the brackets and braces are matched correctly,
and nested correctly.

The tests use the Minitest testing framework. To install it run the command:

    gem install minitest

Run the tests with the `ruby` command:

    ruby bracket_push_test.rb
